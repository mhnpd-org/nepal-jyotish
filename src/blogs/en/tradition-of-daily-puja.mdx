# The Tradition of Daily Worship at Shakti Peethas  

At Gayatri Shakti Peethas, divine symbols of Mother Shakti are installed. These symbols are not merely statues—they are centers of consciousness that are activated by the devotee’s devotion. Therefore, even small daily rituals performed at these places have profound spiritual effects.  

In Hindu culture, symbolic worship is not just tradition; it is a practice connected with psychology and spiritual experience. Devotion-filled rituals allow the presence of divinity to be felt through these symbols. The experiences of Mirabai and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa are clear examples of this. For this reason, all rituals—big or small—at Shakti Peethas must be performed regularly, with purity and heartfelt devotion.

## 1. Awakening  

In the morning, before removing the covering from the deity, a ritual called "awakening" is performed. Though divine consciousness is always awake, the devotee’s mind must be awakened to connect with it.  

During the awakening, the priest performs purification rituals and rings a small bell or claps while reciting mantras. After this, devotees offer salutations to the deity, experiencing the presence of Mother Shakti at the start of the day.

## 2. Purification  

Everything that comes into contact with divine energy must be pure. Hence, the sanctum, the deity, and all associated items are cleaned with full concentration.  

The deity’s face, hands, and feet are wiped with a clean, cold cloth. If needed, the full adornment can be removed for a more thorough cleaning. During this process, recitations such as stutis, chalisas, or Gayatri mantras are performed to invoke devotion.

## 3. Worship Rituals  

After purification, preparations for the morning aarti are made. When the bell signals, all devotees gather to participate in the sixteen-step (Shodashopachar) worship.  

While deities do not require material offerings, the devotee’s devotion, gratitude, and surrender make the worship meaningful. The essence of worship lies in offering one’s highest intentions and heartfelt devotion.

## 4. Aarti  

Discipline and rhythm are essential during aarti. Devotees stand in orderly lines, bells and conch shells are played in synchronization, and the priest performs the sequence of lighting lamps, sprinkling water, waving fans, and sprinkling holy water.  

Aarti is performed in the same manner both in the morning and evening to maintain a divinely charged atmosphere in the Shakti Peetha.

## 5. Food Offerings (Naivedya)  

In Hindu tradition, food offered to the deity is considered prasada and can also serve medicinal and spiritual purposes. When devotees offer sattvic food to Mother Shakti, it is sanctified by divine energy.  

With devotion, purity, and reverence, offerings of water, food, and sip of water (achaman) are made.

## 6. Flower Offerings (Pushpanjali)  

Before closing the temple at night, devotees offer flowers as gratitude for the blessings received throughout the day. The central focus here is the selfless intention with which flowers are offered at the feet of the deity.

---

## 7. Putting the Deity to Rest (Shayan)  

At the end of the day, the deity is symbolically put to rest. Necessary coverings are arranged, and mantras are recited to provide a state of rest for the deity.  

Though this may appear as a simple ritual, its deeper purpose is to bring the devotee’s mind into a state of spiritual closure, acknowledging that the day’s worship has been completed.

## Conclusion  

Daily worship at Shakti Peethas is not merely about rituals and rules—it is a practice that refines the mind, awakens devotion, and deepens the connection with divine consciousness. Even small rituals, when performed with regularity and heartfelt devotion, become highly powerful. Maintaining traditional rituals with sincere participation ensures that the sacred atmosphere of Shakti Peethas remains vibrant and divine.
