# Traditional Hindu Puja Vidhi - Complete Worship Method

## ॐ Shri Hari ॐ

Puja (worship) is a sacred spiritual practice in Hinduism that connects devotees with divine energies. It is not merely a ritual but a profound expression of devotion, reverence, and spiritual advancement.

## Pre-Puja Preparation

Before performing puja to any deity, purification of worship materials and the body is mandatory. Purity and cleanliness are essential for the completion of any worship.

### Achamana (Ritual Sipping of Water)

Begin puja with achamana:

1. **Om Keshavaya Namah** - First achamana
2. **Om Narayanaya Namah** - Second achamana
3. **Om Madhavaya Namah** - Third achamana
4. **Om Hrishikeshaya Namah** - Wash hands with this mantra

### Body Purification Mantra

*Om Apavitrah Pavitro Va Sarvavasthang Gato'pi Va  
Yah Smaret Pundarikaksham Sa Bahyabhyantarah Shuchih*

Sprinkle water on the body while reciting this mantra. Then invoke Lord Ganesha:

*Vakratunda Mahakaya Kotisurya Samaprabha  
Nirvighnam Kuru Me Deva Sarva Karyeshu Sarvada*

## Types of Puja

## Scientific Aspects of Puja

Modern science recognizes several benefits of traditional puja:

- **Mindfulness:** Ritualistic actions promote mental focus and meditation
- **Positive Psychology:** Regular worship creates optimistic mental patterns

## Tips for Daily Puja

1. **Consistency:** Perform puja at the same time daily
2. **Cleanliness:** Maintain purity of body, mind, and environment
3. **Sincerity:** Even simple puja done with devotion is superior to elaborate rituals without feeling
4. **Fresh Offerings:** Use fresh flowers, water, and food items
5. **Concentration:** Focus your mind during worship
6. **Gratitude:** End with thanksgiving and surrender

## Special Notes

- **Shaligram** and **Shivalinga** do not require awakening rituals (prana pratishtha) or invocation/dismissal
- **Tulsi leaves** and **Ganga water** never become stale or impure
- **Tirtha water** (sacred water from pilgrimage sites) does not become stale
- Clothes, sacred threads, and ornaments do not carry the defect of being used
- Flowers kept at the florist's shop do not become stale

## Conclusion

Puja is both a sacred and scientific process. It should be performed with faith, devotion, and a pure heart. While rituals are important, even more crucial is our feeling and dedication. When the heart is pure, even simple worship becomes magnificent.

**"Yo Patram Yo Pushpam Yo Phalam Yo Toyam, Yo Me Bhaktya Prayacchati Tadasham Bhaktyupahritam Ashnami"** - Lord Krishna

Whoever offers Me a leaf, flower, fruit, or water with devotion—I accept that offering made with love.
