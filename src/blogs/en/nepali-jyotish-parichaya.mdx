Nepali Vedic astrology is a living heritage of ancient knowledge. It studies the subtle influence of celestial bodies—planets, constellations, and the zodiac—on human consciousness, temperament, time, and life events.  

## Essence of Astrology

Derived from Sanskrit, *Jyotish* combines "Jyoti" (light) and "Shastra" (science), meaning guidance through illumination. Here, light symbolizes the subtle energies of planets and constellations that indicate life patterns.  

### The Three Foundations

1. **Siddhanta (Principle)** – Precise astronomical calculations, planetary motions, tithi, nakshatra cycles.  
2. **Samhita (Code)** – Analysis of natural events, societal trends, governance, and collective patterns.  
3. **Hora (Horoscopy)** – Individual birth charts, personality, karma, life stages, and planetary periods (Dasha).  

## Social and Cultural Applications

Astrology in Nepal guides daily life and long-term planning:  

| Application | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Muhurta Selection | Determining auspicious times for rituals, house entry, and marriage |
| Marriage Matching | Assessing compatibility and longevity |
| Naming | Choosing letters based on birth nakshatra padas |
| Business Planning | Evaluating financial opportunities and risks |
| Governance | Anticipating social and political trends |

## Birth Chart (Kundali)

A birth chart is a celestial map at the moment of birth, detailing:  

- Ascendant (Lagna) and house structure  
- Planetary positions and house placements  
- Yogas and combinations (Rajyoga, Dhana Yoga, etc.)  
- Dasha/Antardasha sequences (planetary influences over life)  

### Five Panchang Elements

1. **Tithi** – Lunar-solar day characteristics  
2. **Vara** – Weekly energy pattern  
3. **Nakshatra** – Moon constellation influencing mental tendencies  
4. **Yoga** – Combined Sun-Moon influence  
5. **Karana** – Half of a tithi; indicates micro-cycles of action  

## Nine Planets Overview

| Planet | Meaning | Positive Indicators | Challenges |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Sun | Self, authority | Leadership, recognition | Ego, excess energy |
| Moon | Mind, emotion | Compassion, adaptability | Instability |
| Mars | Energy, courage | Bravery, protection | Aggression, disputes |
| Mercury | Intellect, commerce | Analysis, communication | Indecision, restlessness |
| Jupiter | Knowledge, virtue | Growth, wisdom | Over-optimism |
| Venus | Beauty, emotion | Love, creativity | Excess indulgence |
| Saturn | Karma, discipline | Patience, structure | Delay, restrictions |
| Rahu | Ambition, desire | Innovation, technology | Confusion, unstable goals |
| Ketu | Liberation, spirituality | Insight, detachment | Separation, disinterest |

## Zodiac Groups

- **Fire**: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius — motivation, activity, leadership  
- **Earth**: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn — practicality, stability, structure  
- **Air**: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius — intellect, communication, social skills  
- **Water**: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces — emotion, intuition, sensitivity  

## Practice and Responsibility

Astrology guides but does not determine fate. A chart indicates potential, tendencies, and timing; actual results depend on conscious actions, discipline, and decisions.  

### Study Tips

1. Observe the relationships among Lagna, Moon, and Sun.  
2. Compare Dasha sequences with planetary positions.  
3. Interpret Yogas in the context of the full chart.  
4. Transits and Dasha alignment amplify events.  
5. Focus on key houses: Lagna, Moon, 10th (karma), 9th (dharma), 7th (relationships).  

## Conclusion

Nepali traditional astrology reflects life’s subtle patterns. Applied responsibly, it enhances self-awareness, time management, and long-term clarity. Ultimately, outcomes are shaped by deliberate action and conscious effort.
